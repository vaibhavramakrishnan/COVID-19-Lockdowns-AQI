# COVID-19-Lockdowns-AQI

The current study attempted to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on the Air Quality Index in Delhi and Mumbai in March, April, and May of early 2020. The main pollutants in this study were NO2, CO, and PM10. The findings clearly demonstrate a significant improvement in air quality during lockdowns in both cities, owing to a decrease in pollutant concentrations.
